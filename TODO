Next step: create a test chat between Cinder client and an Eliza bot.

1. Client: create Identity
2. Client: create UserNode
3. Client: create CameraNode
3. Bot: create Identity
4. Bot: create UserNode
5. Client: test that you can see the a user node of the bot
6. Client: create a ChatObject
7. Bot: recognize and store ChatObject
8. Client: create a ChatMessageNode
9. Client: check that ChatObject can move ChatMessageNodes
10.Bot: create a ChatMessageNode
11.Client: check that created Node has proper links

Note:
* Update ChatMessageNode to contain a bool in attr()["finished"] when enter is pressed.
  Perhaps this could be a more universal flag. Deactivate. Attention-Lost

node = new GenericNode(Utility::create_uuid());

// NOTE: this method binds GL textures, and therefore MUST be in the setup() method.
node->init();
